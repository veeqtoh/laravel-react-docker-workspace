## This is where your React app goes

To get started, **delete this file** and then do one of the following:

- Clone your project or copy all of the files directly into this `src/frontend` directory.
- Spin up the Docker network by following the instructions on the main [README.md](../README.md), and install a brand new React project by running `docker-compose run --rm npx create-react-app` in your terminal.
